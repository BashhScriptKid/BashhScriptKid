## Henlo!

Just a random script kiddie (probably) that desperately trying to either make, or contribute something.

### Pronoun
Any pronoun goes! <sub>Some might call me queer for this but personally no.</sub>

### Things
Current focus: [JANOARG](https://github.com/FFF40/JANOARG)

(Also check out: [fStreamDecryptor](https://github.com/BashhScriptKid/fStreamDecryptor), [osu!Edgeflow](https://codeberg.org/BashhScriptKid/osuEdgeflow))

### Internal thoughts
I kinda need some assistance here... :/

### Stacks(?)
I don't really show my stacks (in a _fancy_ way) here because I'm not really predictable myself (and lazy)
But the gist is:
  - Have decent experience:
    - C#
    - Bash (real)
    - Figma
    - Krita/Photopea/Photoshop (Image manipulation softwares)
  - Can work, but barely used:
    - Python
  - Learning:
    - C
    - Graphic/Shader bullsh*ts
    - TypeScript (f*ck JavaScript)
